# Cue ðŸŽ¬

A simple and robust actor framework for building stateful applications in TypeScript.

Tired of state management turning into a chaotic drama? **Cue** is your application's poised **director**, bringing order and comfort to the stage. It orchestrates your application's state into standalone, persistent, and fault-tolerant **actors** that communicate through well-defined **messages**.

## Why Choose Cue?

- **Effortless State, Seriously.** Powered by Immer, state updates are as simple and safe as direct mutation. Cue handles the complex plumbing, so you don't have to.
- **Actor Model Made Easy.** Each actor has a private mailbox, processing commands sequentially. This ensures a clear, single-threaded, and replayable flow without manual locking.
- **Fault-Tolerant by Design.** Gracefully handle errors with declarative supervision strategies (`resume`, `reset`, `stop`) without cluttering your business logic.
- **Complete Type-Safety.** Enjoy TypeScript's powerful type hints and error checking. Commands, queries, and their payloads have clear, reliable type boundaries.
- **Persistence Made Pluggable.** Actors can remember their state, gracefully surviving restarts. With a simple `PatchStore` interface, you can plug in any database you need.
- **Seamless State Evolution.** Your application will change, and so will your state. Cue's upcasting mechanism lets you evolve actor state schemas over time with simple, pure functionsâ€”no complex data migrations required.
- **Automatic Resource Management.** Built-in passivation automatically frees up memory for idle actors, keeping your application lean and scalable.
- **Smart Serialization.** Automatically serialize and deserialize complex types like `Date`, `Map`, `Set`, `BigInt`, and `RegExp` right out of the box, powered by SuperJSON.
- **Expressive Streaming APIs.** Easily handle long-running tasks and communicate real-time progress to callers through convenient streaming commands.

## A Five-Minute Introduction

Let's write a simple play starring a `Character` actor.

```typescript
// 1. Define the actor's script
import { createActorManager, defineActor } from "cue";

const Character = defineActor("Character")
  .initialState(() => ({
    level: 1,
    hp: 100,
    quests: new Set<string>(),
  }))
  .commands({
    // A simple, synchronous command
    takeDamage: (state, amount: number) => {
      // `state` is a mutable draft powered by Immer
      state.hp -= amount;
      if (state.hp <= 0) {
        state.hp = 0;
        return "You have been defeated!";
      }
      return `Ouch! HP is now ${state.hp}.`;
    },
    // An async command
    levelUp: async (state) => {
      // Simulate some async work
      await new Promise((res) => setTimeout(res, 50));
      state.level++;
      state.hp += 10;
      return `Ding! Reached level ${state.level}!`;
    },
    // A streaming command using an async generator
    startQuest: async function* (state, quest: string) {
      if (state.quests.has(quest)) {
        yield { status: "already_on_quest" };
        return "Quest already started.";
      }
      state.quests.add(quest);
      yield { status: "started", quest };
      // Simulate a long journey
      await new Promise((res) => setTimeout(res, 100));
      yield { status: "completed", quest };
      state.quests.delete(quest);
      return "Quest complete!";
    },
  })
  .queries({
    // A read-only query for safe state access
    getStats: (state) => ({
      level: state.level,
      hp: state.hp,
    }),
  })
  .build();

// 2. Create an actor manager
const manager = createActorManager({ definition: Character });

// 3. Get a reference to a specific actor by its unique ID
const playerOne = manager.get("player-one");

// 4. Send messages to the actor!
// 'tell' executes a command. It returns a promise with the command's result.
const damageResult = await playerOne.tell.takeDamage(10);
console.log(damageResult); // "Ouch! HP is now 90."

const levelUpMessage = await playerOne.tell.levelUp();
console.log(levelUpMessage); // "Ding! Reached level 2!"

// 'ask' executes a query for read-only access.
const stats = await playerOne.ask.getStats();
console.log(stats); // { level: 2, hp: 110 }

// 'stream' lets you iterate over progress from a streaming command.
console.log("Starting a new quest...");
const questStream = playerOne.stream.startQuest("The Lost Amulet");
for await (const update of questStream) {
  console.log(`Quest update: ${update.status}`);
}
// > Quest update: started
// > Quest update: completed

// 'inspect' gives a direct snapshot of the actor's current state and version.
const snapshot = await playerOne.inspect();
console.log(snapshot.state.quests); // Set(0) {}

// Don't forget to shut down the manager when your app closes!
await manager.shutdown();
```

## Key Concepts

### The Script (`defineActor`)

The **script** is the blueprint for your actors, created with a fluent, builder-style API.

- `.initialState(() => ({...}))`: Sets the default state for new actors.
- `.commands({...})`: Defines methods that can alter state. These can be synchronous, async, or async generators (for streaming).
- `.queries({...})`: Defines read-only methods for safe, consistent state access.
- `.evolveTo((prevState) => ({...}))`: Defines a migration function to upgrade an actor's state from an older schema to a newer one.
- `.persistence({...})`: Configures persistence behavior like snapshotting.
- `.build()`: Finalizes the definition, making it ready to use.

### The Director (`createActorManager`)

The **director** is the central organizer for all actor instances of a given definition. Its primary job is to instantiate, retrieve, and manage the lifecycle of actors. You create one with `createActorManager` and get actor references from it via `manager.get("some-unique-id")`.

### The Performer (`ActorRef`)

The **performer** is your handle for interacting with a specific actor instance. It provides several clear "verbs" to communicate:

- `tell`: Execute a command that may modify state. If the command is a stream, `tell` drains it completely and returns only the final `return` value.
- `ask`: Execute a query to read state safely and consistently, without causing side effects.
- `stream`: Get an `AsyncIterable` from a streaming command to process `yield`ed progress updates.
- `inspect`: Instantly get a snapshot of the actor's current state and version for debugging.
- `shutdown`: Manually shut down and release the actor from memory. Alternatively, let the manager handle it automatically with passivation.

## Advanced Features

### Persistence: An Actor Never Forgets

Cue offers first-class persistence. By providing an object that implements the `PatchStore` interface, every state change is saved. When an actor is needed, it's rehydrated from its history, ensuring no data is ever lost.

To enable persistence, simply provide a `store` during manager creation.

```typescript
import { createActorManager } from "cue";
import type { PatchStore } from "cue";
import { myActorDef } from "./my-actor-def.js";

// You can implement the PatchStore interface for any database (e.g., Postgres, Redis, etc.)
class MyPostgresAdapter implements PatchStore {
  // ... implementation for commit, load, commitSnapshot, acquire, release, etc.
}

const manager = createActorManager({
  definition: myActorDef,
  store: new MyPostgresAdapter(process.env.DATABASE_URL),
});
```

To prevent performance degradation from replaying long event histories, you can enable snapshotting. Cue will periodically save a full snapshot of an actor's state.

```typescript
defineActor("MyActor")
  //...
  .persistence({
    snapshotEvery: 100, // Create a state snapshot every 100 versions
  })
  .build();
```

### State Evolution: Your Schema's Second Act

As your application evolves, so will its state. Cue makes changing your actor's state schema a non-event with built-in support for upcasting.

Simply chain `.evolveTo()` calls in your actor definition. When an actor with an older state version is hydrated, Cue will automatically run your upcaster functions in order, seamlessly migrating the state to the latest schema.

```typescript
// V1 of our Character actor
const Character = defineActor("Character").initialState(() => ({
  name: "Player",
  hitPoints: 100,
}));

// Let's say we saved some actors with the V1 schema. Now, we need to change it.

// V2 introduces a structured 'health' property
const Character = defineActor("Character")
  .initialState(() => ({
    // The V1 initial state is the starting point
    name: "Player",
    hitPoints: 100,
  }))
  // Evolve from the V1 state shape to the V2 shape
  .evolveTo((v1State) => ({
    name: v1State.name,
    health: {
      current: v1State.hitPoints,
      max: 100,
    },
    mana: 50, // We can also add new fields
  }))
  .commands({
    takeDamage: (state, amount: number) => {
      // Logic now uses the new state.health property
      state.health.current -= amount;
      state.hitPoints; // This will error
    },
  })
  .build();

// When manager.get("some-old-v1-actor-id") is called with the CharacterV2 definition,
// its state will be automatically migrated. No manual scripts needed!
```

### Supervision: Fault Tolerance

What happens when an error occurs in the middle of a state update? In many systems, this can leave your application in a corrupt, unpredictable state. Cue solves this with a powerful, two-layered approach to fault tolerance:

1. **Transactional Updates:** When a command fails, all its attempted state changes are automatically rolled back. Your actor's state remains untouched and consistent, just as it was before the command ran. This eliminates a whole class of bugs related to partial updates.

2. **Centralized Supervision:** With state consistency guaranteed, a **supervisor** decides the actor's fate. This decouples your business logic from your error recovery policy, letting you define clear, declarative strategies for different types of failures.

A supervisor can choose one of three strategies, each suited for a different class of error:

- **`resume`**: The actor's state is preserved, and the error is passed to the original caller.

  - **When to use it:** For transient or input-related errors. The actor's internal state is still valid, but the specific operation failed. The actor is healthy and ready for the next message.
  - **Example:** A `ValidationError` is thrown because a user tried to withdraw a negative amount from a bank account actor. The account's state is fine; the request was simply invalid.

- **`stop`**: The actor is terminated and will reject all future messages.

  - **When to use it:** For catastrophic, unrecoverable errors where even restarting is not a solution. This is for when the environment or configuration for an actor is broken.
  - **Example:** An actor that relies on a specific API key fails because the key is missing or invalid. Restarting won't help, as the fundamental configuration is broken. Stopping the actor prevents it from running in a useless, error-prone state.

- **`reset`**: The actor's state is reset to its initial value, as if it were brand new. The caller receives a `ResetError`.

  - **Important!** If you are using a persistence store, this reset is also persisted. It effectively **wipes the actor's history and starts from a clean slate.** This is a powerful but destructive action that should be used only if something went **_really_** wrong.
  - **When to use it:** When an actor's state is so corrupt that it's safer to start over entirely than to attempt recovery. It's the "hard reset" for a specific actor, used when you're willing to discard its accumulated data. The caller that triggered the error receives a specific `ResetError` to indicate what happened.
  - **Example:** A ShoppingCart actor fails during checkout because a bug has allowed an invalid item ID to be added to its state. Attempting to process the order throws an InvalidCartStateError. Instead of leaving the user with a broken cart they can't empty or check out, the supervisor's `reset` strategy clears the cart, allowing the user to start again. **The loss of cart data is preferable to a permanent error state.**

```typescript
import type { Supervisor } from "cue";

const mySupervisor: Supervisor = {
  strategy: (state, error) => {
    console.error(`Actor failed with state:`, state, `and error:`, error);
    if (error.name === "ValidationError") {
      // The operation was invalid, but the actor is fine.
      return "resume";
    }
    if (error.name === "CatastrophicConfigError") {
      // The actor cannot function.
      return "stop";
    }
    // For any other unexpected error, assume state may be corrupt.
    // WARNING: This will discard the actor's persisted data.
    return "reset";
  },
};

const manager = createActorManager({
  definition: myActorDef,
  supervisor: mySupervisor,
});
```

#### How Do You Recover from a `stop`?

The `stop` strategy is a terminal state for a given actor instance, signaling an unrecoverable error. You cannot "un-stop" or resume a stopped actor. Think of it like a process that has crashed due to a fatal errorâ€”the process is gone, and you need to start a new one after fixing the problem.

Recovery is a two-step process that happens outside the actor itself:

1. **Fix the Root Cause:** A `stop` implies a fundamental problem with the actor's environment or configuration that a `resume` won't fix. This must be resolved externally.

   - If the error was a bug, you need to **deploy new code**.
   - If it was a missing API key, you need to **update your application's configuration or environment variables**.
   - If it was a database connection issue, you need to **restore the database connection**.

2. **Get a New Actor Reference:** Once the underlying problem is fixed, you can get a new, healthy actor reference. The simplest and most common way to do this is by **restarting your application**.

When your application restarts, a new `ActorManager` is created. When you next call `manager.get("some-stopped-actor-id")`, the manager will create a _brand new_ actor instance. This new instance will attempt to hydrate from the persistence store. Since you've fixed the root cause, the hydration should now succeed, and you'll have a healthy, running actor.

Here's a conceptual example:

```typescript
// --- In your application code ---
const actor = manager.get("critical-actor");

try {
  await actor.tell.performCriticalTask();
} catch (error) {
  // Assume our supervisor has chosen 'stop' for this error
  console.error(
    "Actor 'critical-actor' was stopped. A fix and restart are required."
  );
  // At this point, you would typically alert your monitoring system.
  // The 'actor' reference is now permanently failed.
}

// --- Later, after you've deployed a fix and restarted the app... ---

// A new manager is created on app startup
const newManager = createActorManager({
  /*... your config ...*/
});
// Getting the actor by the same ID now works because the root cause is fixed.
const newActorRef = newManager.get("critical-actor");
// This will now succeed!
await newActorRef.tell.performCriticalTask();
```

### Passivation: Automatic Resource Management

To save memory, you can configure the manager to **passivate** (i.e., automatically shut down and evict) actors that have been idle for a certain period. When a message is next sent to the passivated actor, Cue will seamlessly rehydrate it from your persistence store.

_Note: A `store` is required for passivation to be useful._

```typescript
const manager = createActorManager({
  definition: myActorDef,
  store: myPersistenceAdapter,
  passivation: {
    idleAfter: 5 * 60 * 1000, // Evict after 5 minutes of inactivity
    sweepInterval: 60 * 1000, // Check for idle actors every minute (default)
  },
});
```

### Metrics: Observability

Gain insight into your actors' lifecycle by providing a `metrics` object with callback hooks. This is perfect for integrating with your favorite logging or monitoring service.

```typescript
import type { ActorMetrics, Patch } from "cue";

const myMetrics: ActorMetrics = {
  onHydrate: (id) => console.log(`[Metrics] Actor ${id} was hydrated.`),
  onEvict: (id) => console.log(`[Metrics] Actor ${id} was passivated.`),
  onError: (id, error) => console.error(`[Metrics] Actor ${id} failed:`, error),
  onSnapshot: (id, version) =>
    console.log(
      `[Metrics] Actor ${id} created snapshot at version ${version}.`
    ),
  onAfterCommit: (id, version, patch) => {
    console.log(
      `[Metrics] Actor ${id} committed version ${version} with ${patch.length} changes.`
    );
  },
};

const manager = createActorManager({
  definition: myActorDef,
  metrics: myMetrics,
});
```
